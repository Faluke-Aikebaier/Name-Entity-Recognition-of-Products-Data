# Name-Entity-Recognition-of-Products-Data

The project is to regognize & extract [Named Entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) from several fields on the corpus. Corpus comes as is, so it's up to the data-scientist to decide how to label the data & train the model. There are 119 unique providers which describe their products in a certain way. This helps the labelling process as one can see below. Suggested Named Entities are (at least, depends on the row-data): BRAND, SIZE, COLOR, SIZE, WEIGHT, etc.
